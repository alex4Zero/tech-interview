* Implement data structure "Map" storing pairs of integers (key, value) and define following member functions in O(1) runtime: void insert(key, value), void delete(key), int get(key), int getRandomKey().  
* Given a string A and B, find the smallest substring of A that contains all the characters from B. (implement solution in O(n), keep in mind chars in B can repeat)  
* Binary tree serialization/deserialization
